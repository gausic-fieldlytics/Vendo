The Independent Service Providers (ISP) / Agency have access to the Application to receive and review Tasks for services from Vendo and to determine their interest in and availability to respond to such Tasks.</p>

        <p>You may also refer to our Privacy Policy to understand how we process and protect your information.</p>
        
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. In acceptance of this agreement, it is clearly understood that you have been able to interpret this agreement in a language of your understanding or used the services of a person who has been able to explain this to you in a language of your understanding.</strong></p>        

        <p><strong>Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency Services Agreement</strong></p>
        <p>This Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency Services Agreement (“Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) is an electronic contract that sets out the legally binding terms of the relationship between Vendo and you. By registering with Vendo as an independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Please read it carefully. By accessing the Application or becoming an Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency, you accept this Agreement and agree to the terms, conditions and notices contained and/or referenced herein. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior written agreements with you.</p>

        <p>Tasks are together and interchangeably used to represent assignments that are displayed on the Vendo application for you to receive and review, and then choose to undertake on an independent basis, as an Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency, any of such assignments on a non-exclusive basis.</p>

        <p>Vendo reserves the right to change this Agreement, and add additional terms at any time, effective upon making the modified provisions available on the Application or by notifying Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency directly. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Terms of Use for modifications and updates to its terms. Continued use of the Application after any such changes are made to this Agreement shall constitute your consent to such changes. Other than making the changes available on the Application, Vendo does not assume any obligation to notify Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency / Agency Representative (AR) of any changes to this Agreement, or the creation or modification of any additional terms.</p>

        <p><strong>Notwithstanding the previous paragraph or any contrary language in this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 9 of this Agreement may not be modified or terminated absent a writing signed (electronically or otherwise) by the Company and You</strong></p>

        <p>You acknowledge that you are able to electronically receive, download, and print this Agreement, any other terms, notices, and any other notices or documents required by, or incorporated into, this Agreement by reference, any amendments to this Agreement, or any other items required by regulation or law. Further, you agree to keep the contact information in your Account current at all times including, but not limited to, your email address, physical address, and phone number and bank details.</p>

        <p>Use of the Application is permitted only by individuals and wherever permitted, by Agency who register on the Vendo platform/application/services online through any electronic medium and can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.</p>

        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, in the case of ISP, you must be at least 18 years old [or the age of legal majority in the jurisdiction in which you work] and legally authorized to work. If you do not meet these criteria, you may not register to become an Independent Service Provider (ISP).  In case you are registering as an Agency, the complete details of the Agency and its constitution, viz., whether it is a LLP, Proprietorship, partnership, private Limited, etc., the various individuals who constitute the Agency and the names of the persons responsible for the business of the Agency shall be provided.  Any change in the constitution of the Agency or the persons responsible for the business of the Agency shall be promptly communicated to Vendo.

        <div class="page-break">
            <h4>1. Definitions</h4>
            <p>Capitalized terms are defined as set forth below or elsewhere in the Agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>1.1 “Services”</strong> means the services described in a Vendo Task for services by a Independent Service Provider (ISP)/Agency.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2 “Vendo Task”</strong> means a notice provided, through the Application, to one or more Independent Service Provider (ISP) or Agencies, which includes a description of the services to be provided by the Independent Service Provider (ISP) or Agency, the times at which the Vendo Task begins and must be completed, and the fee associated with the Vendo Task (the “Payment”). An open Task is a Task for services that has not yet been accepted by a Independent Service Provider (ISP) or Agency (“Open Task”). Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency can use the Application to review Open Tasks and to indicate their availability for Open Tasks. Once a Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency has accepted a Vendo Task pursuant to Section 2, the Vendo Task will become a “Vendo Engagement”. Each Vendo Engagement constitutes a new contract between Vendo and the Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency.</p>
            <p><strong>1.3 “Vendo Mobile Application” or “Application”</strong> means the software application used by Vendo in connection with the Services.</p>

            <h4>2. Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency</h4>
            <p><strong>2.1 Conditional Offer Requirements and Privacy Information.</strong> Some Tasks may require completion of certain steps or requirements prior or after you accept a Vendo Task but before you perform the Vendo Task (“Conditional Offer Requirements”). Such Conditional Offer Requirements will be explained prior or after you accept the Vendo Task. Failure to complete such Conditional Offer Requirements to the satisfaction of the Vendo will result in Vendo treating the same as your inability to perform accepted Vendo Tasks.</p>            
            <p>2.2 Vendo Assures that all personal information/data collected from ISP/Agency/AR shall be utilized only in furtherance to the requirements under this agreement and Vendo assures that the same shall not be disclosed in public domain except to the extent it is necessary for the performance and due discharge of this agreement or for legal compliance to the extent required or when called upon to declare by any statutory authority.

Once a Independent Service Provider (ISP)or Agency has accepted a Vendo Task, the Open Task will no longer be available for performance by other Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency who received the Open Task. By accepting an Open Task, you are entering into a binding legal agreement to provide the Services for the Payment specified in the Open Task. Do not accept an Open Task unless you are sure that:</p>

                <li>(a) you understand what you are being asked to deliver;</li>
                <li>(b) you can perform the Services identified in the Open Task;</li>
                <li>(c) you can deliver the Services in the Tasked time period;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and if required, you can get to and from the location where the services are to be delivered. If you fail to show up at the location by the specified start time as noted on the Vendo Task, Vendo in their sole discretion may cancel the Vendo Task with or without, any penalty. Failure to timely deliver the Services consistent with the requirements and specifications will constitute a breach, resulting in non-payment and / or forfeiture / recovery of the payment . Further, in the event of such a breach, you will be responsible for payment of any additional fees or costs incurred as a result of your failure to complete within the stipulated time, the Open Task in accordance with the requirements, including and not limited to engaging other parties to complete and deliver the Services and Vendo having to take steps to ensure the Task is completed to Vendo client’s satisfaction.
