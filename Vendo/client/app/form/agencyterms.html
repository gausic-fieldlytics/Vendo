    <h4>1. Definitions</h4>
    <p>Capitalized terms are defined as set forth below or elsewhere in the Agreement.</p>
    <p> <b>1.1 "Services" </b> means the services described in a Vendo Task for services by aIndependent Service
      Provider
      (ISP)/Agency.</p>
    <p> <b>1.2 "Vendo Task" </b> means a notice provided, through the Application, to one or more Independent Service
      Provider
      (ISP)or Agencies, which includes a description of the services to be provided by the Independent Service Provider
      (ISP)or Agency, the times at which the Vendo Task begins and must be completed, and the fee associated with the
      Vendo
      Task (the "Payment"). An open Task is a Task for services that has not yet been accepted by aIndependent Service
      Provider (ISP)or Agency ("Open Task"). Independent Service Provider (ISP)/ Agency can use the Application to
      review
      Open Tasks and to indicate their availability for Open Tasks. Once aIndependent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency
      has
      accepted a Vendo Task pursuant to Section 2, the Vendo Task will become a "VendoEngagement". Each Vendo Engagement
      constitutes a new contract between Vendo and the Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency.</p>
    <p> <b>1.3 "Vendo Mobile Application"</b> or <b>"Application"</b> means the software application used by Vendo in
      connection with

    <p><b> 2.1 Conditional Offer Requirements and Privacy Information.</b> Some Tasks may require completion of certain
      steps or
      requirements prior or after you accept a Vendo Taskbut before you perform the Vendo Task ("Conditional Offer
      Requirements"). Such Conditional Offer Requirements will be explained prior or after you accept the Vendo Task.
      Failure to complete such Conditional Offer Requirements to the satisfaction of the Vendo will result in Vendo
      treating
      the same as your inability to perform accepted VendoTasks. </p>
    <p>2.2 Vendo Assures that all personal information/data collected from ISP/Agency/AR shall be utilized only in
      furtherance to the requirements under this agreement and Vendo assures that the same shall not be disclosed in

      Open
      Task,
      you agree to use your best efforts to perform the Vendo Engagement such that the Services meet the requirements
      and
      specifications. Once aIndependent Service Provider (ISP)or Agency has accepted a Vendo Task, the Open Task will no
      longer be available for performance by other Independent Service Provider (ISP)/ Agency who received the Open
      Task. By
      accepting an Open Task, you are entering into a binding legal agreement to provide the Services for the Payment

      at the location by the specified start time as noted on the Vendo Task, Vendo in their sole discretion may cancel
      the
      Vendo Task with or without, any penalty. Failure to timely deliver the Services consistent with the requirements
      and
      specifications will constitute a breach, resulting in non-paymentand / or forfeiture / recovery of the payment .
      Further, in the event of such a breach, you will be responsible for payment of any additional fees or costs
      incurred
      as a result of your failure to complete within the stipulated time, the Open Task in accordance with the
      requirements,
      including and not limited to engaging other parties to complete and deliver the Services and Vendo having to take
      steps to ensure the Task is completed to Vendo client's satisfaction. You agree to not possess, sell, receive, or

      Vendo engagement has been completed in accordance with the quality / quantity and other prescriptions that may be
      specified in the Vendo Task</p>
    <p>Vendo does not restrict the Independent Service Provider's (ISP's) / Agency's right to provide services to other
      parties, including competitors of the Vendo Mobile Application; Vendo expects that the ISP who has registered with
      Vendo has such necessary skills and is performing / capable of performing similar services to other parties;</p>

      source of
      income; As the acceptance of Vendo Task floated by Vendo through the application is on the basis of the first

      minimum
      guarantee amounts nor does Vendo offer Independent Service Provider (ISP) / Agency / Agency Representative an

      or

      Vendo
      expects that the Vendo assignments taken up by the ISP /Agency is in accordance with the quality and such
      standards as
      specified in the Vendo Task and in this context, Vendo is entitled to depute such person or persons as may be
      required
      to ascertain that the Vendo assignment has indeed been completed in accordance with the Vendo Task so undertaken
      by
      the ISP / Agency;</p>
    <p>Vendo does not terminate the work during the term of this Agreement unless the Independent Service Provider
      (ISP)/
      Agency violates the terms of this Agreement or fails to produce results that meets the specifications of the
      Agreement, either in terms of quality or the specified timelines for the Tasks;</p>

    <h4> 8. Additional Terms applicable to Agency registering withVendo.</h4>
    <p>In addition to the various terms that may apply under
      this agreement, if the service provider is not an ISP but an agency, such Agency is bound by the following
      additional
      terms:-</p>
    <p>8.1 Agency acknowledges and represents that Agency will use its own personnel (Agency Representatives - AR) to
      execute the Tasks and such AR of the Agency are in no way connected to Vendo. The engagement of such AR and their
      use
      of the Vendo Application to carry out Tasks undertaken by the Agency in no way constitute a relationship between
      Vendo
      and the AR. The Agency shall ensure that it shall always comply with all relevant laws that bind its association
      with
      the AR and that the Agency shall keep Vendo indemnified at all times from any claims of non-compliance of relevant
      laws that may arise at any time. It is further reiterated that the Agency's association with Vendo under this
      agreement is purely on a Principal to Principal basis and the AR can at no time seek employment with Vendo, for
      which
      the Agency unconditionally indemnifies Vendo.</p>
    <p>8.2 It is open to the agency to depute such Agency representatives who are competent and possess the required
      skill
      to undertake the Vendo task undertaken by the Agency without any interference from Vendo. In such an event, Vendo
      shall only permit restricted access to the AR to have access to the Vendo Application to the limited extent which
      is
      necessary for due discharge of his duties as an AR of the Agency.</p>
    <p>8.3 The Agency specifically agrees that this agreement is not only binding on the Agency but also is binding on
      the
      AR who is deputed by the Agency to undertake the Vendo engagement and it is the responsibility of the Agency to
      make
      its AR's aware of the terms of the engagement under this agreement.</p>
    <p>8.4 Agency understands and undertake that any AR that you may employ, engage or otherwise retain to undertake or
      assist with performance of Services under this Agreement meet the skill requirements to undertake the Tasks and
      will
      execute the Tasks in the best possible manner of quality, workmanship and timely completion. Agency shall further
      ensure that the AR are classified and covered under any applicable laws and Agency shall keep Vendo indemnified at
      all
      times from any claims that may arise from any non-compliance on part the part of the Agency.</p>
    <p>8.5 Agency is not providing and will not provide labour services to Vendo for remuneration, but rather, Agency
      can
      use the Application to find and, if the Agency so desires / wishes, accept Vendo Tasks as anAgency and then assign
      such Tasks to an AR of the choice of the Agency. </p>
    <p>8.6 Any AR that the Agency deploys should be registered by the Agency on the Vendo app for the AR to review,
      record
      and report the Tasks Agency has assigned to such AR but such use of the Vendo application shall not constitute any
      direct relationship between the AR and Vendo.</p>
    <p>8.7 Agency is aware that Vendo does not in any manner depute its representatives to supervise the Vendo
      assignment
      undertaken by the Agency and in respect of which AR is deputed to work. Thus, it is the responsibility of the
      Agency
      to depute its own supervisors and such required personnel to supervise the work of the AR without any interference
      from Vendo. As such, it is entirely the responsibility of the Agency to ensure that the Vendo assignment is
      completed
      on such terms as has been undertaken by them in the Vendo Task.</p>
    <p>8.8 The Agency shall discharge all its statutory liabilities including all such payments that may be due and
      payable
      by the Agency to its AR's. The Agency shall at all times keep Vendo indemnified against any claims that may be
      made
      against Vendo in this regard. If at any point of time, Vendo is called upon under any order of court or any such
      statutory authority to make any such payments that may be due to AR by the Agency, Vendo reserves their right to
      make
      such payments in compliance with the order and recover the same from the Agency, together with costs and
      consequences
      thereof.</p>
